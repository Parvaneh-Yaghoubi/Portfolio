# Personal Portfolio 

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. A digital space to showcase my skills, projects, education, and certifications in a clean and elegant manner. Built with pure HTML and CSS, this site reflects both creativity and structure.

## Theme & Inspiration

The theme of this portfolio is **Modern Minimalism with a Touch of Neon Glow**. Inspired by dark-themed developer portfolios and futuristic UI aesthetics, I chose a black background to highlight soft purples and whites, creating a focused, high-contrast experience. Fonts were carefully selected to give each section its own voice while maintaining coherence across the design.

## Design Decisions

- **Color Palette:**  
  - **Primary:** `#bc8cf2` (lavender/purple glow)  
  - **Background:** `#000000` (true black)  
  - These colors offer a sleek and modern look, while maintaining readability and visual hierarchy.

- **Typography:**  
  - Used different font families to distinguish section types:
    - *Roboto* for headings
    - *Noto Sans* for body text
    - A playful handwritten font (`Gaegu-Bold`) for special accents

- **Responsiveness:**  
  - Flexbox and media queries ensure mobile compatibility, with a collapsible hamburger menu on smaller screens.

- **Animations:**  
  - Smooth CSS keyframe animations in the typing section enhance user engagement without relying on JavaScript.

- **Sections Included:**  
  - Navbar with responsive design  
  - Typing effect intro section  
  - About section with profile image  
  - Skills with animated progress bars  
  - Education timeline  
  - Interactive project cards  
  - 3D flip-style certificate gallery  
  - Contact form  
  - Scroll-to-top button  
  - Footer with social links

## Challenges Faced

- **Typing Animation with Multiple Words:**  
  Creating a pure-CSS typing animation that rotates through multiple words with timing precision was a bit tricky. Each word needed its own keyframe logic and careful overlap tuning.

- **Responsive Certificate Flip Effect:**  
  Making the 3D flip work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile screens involved managing perspective and hover behavior effectively, without breaking the layout.

- **Maintaining Visual Balance:**  
  Ensuring all sections looked balanced with consistent padding, spacing, and alignment — especially on variable screen sizes — required a lot of fine-tuning.

## Future Improvements

- Add dark/light toggle theme with JavaScript  
- Enhance accessibility (ARIA labels, better contrast ratios)  
- Convert to React or Svelte for smoother component management
